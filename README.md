# Car-Price-Prediction
This project is made with the idea to encounter every possible future datasets with simple loading of path file inside the code.
I have included almost every possible regression algorithms like linear regression, polynmial linear regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest, ADABoost, XGBoost, SVR model, L1, L2, ElasticNet Regression.
I have not run hyperparameter tuning as it takes time and computationally expensive but it did work in the past so we are all set to go.
